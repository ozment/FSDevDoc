NodeJS CodeSpace Template

Structuring a Node.js project effectively is crucial for maintainability, scalability, and ease of understanding. Here's a typical structure for a Node.js project using modules:

### 1. Basic Structure

- **`/src`** - This is the main directory where your source code lives.
  - **`/api`** - If your project exposes an API, you can keep your endpoint definitions here.
  - **`/config`** - Contains configuration files that control your app settings according to the environment it's running in.
  - **`/controllers`** - Responsible for handling input and returning responses to the client.
  - **`/models`** - Contains files that define data models and interact with databases.
  - **`/services`** - Holds business logic, often where functions are called by controllers.
  - **`/routes`** - Defines URL routes and maps them to controller functions.
  - **`/middlewares`** - Contains middleware functions for things like authentication and logging.
  - **`/helpers`** - Utility functions and helpers that can be used throughout the app.
  - **`/views`** - If your application serves HTML (e.g., using EJS, Pug), the templates or views would be placed here.

- **`/public`** - This directory holds static files like images, scripts, and stylesheets.
- **`/test`** - Contains your tests, potentially mirroring the structure of `/src`.
- **`/node_modules`** - Contains all your npm dependencies, automatically created when you run `npm install`.
- **`/scripts`** - Utility scripts for deployment, running tests, etc.

### 2. Root-Level Files

- **`package.json`** - Manages project metadata, scripts, dependencies, and more.
- **`package-lock.json`** or **`yarn.lock`** - Automatically generated to lock dependencies to specific versions.
- **`README.md`** - A markdown file containing the project's introduction, setup instructions, and other essential information.
- **`.gitignore`** - Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- **`.env`** - A file for environment-specific variables that should not be tracked in version control for security reasons.
- **`app.js`** or **`server.js`** - The entry point to your application.

### 3. Additional Considerations

- **Version control** (e.g., Git): Initialize in the root of your project to track changes and collaborate.
- **Environment-specific configurations**: Use modules like `dotenv` to manage environment variables.
- **Error Handling**: Implement centralized error handling in a middleware.
- **Logging**: Use libraries like `winston` or `morgan` for logging.
- **Security**: Implement security best practices, such as setting HTTP headers with `helmet` and rate limiting with `express-rate-limit`.

### Example File Tree

```
/my-node-project
  /node_modules
  /src
    /api
    /config
    /controllers
    /models
    /services
    /routes
    /middlewares
    /helpers
    /views
  /public
  /test
  /scripts
  .gitignore
  .env
  README.md
  package.json
  package-lock.json
  server.js
```

This structure provides a good starting point, but you should adjust it based on the specific needs and scale of your project.
